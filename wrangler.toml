# NOTE:
#   We only use Wrangler for the `wrangler dev` command.
#
#   Contributors:
#     Attach your own Cloudflare Account credentials. This
#     is safe/okay since these values will (and should)
#     never leave your machine.
#   Maintainers:
#     Deployments are done ONLY thru the GitHub Action workflow.
#     For local development, follow the Contributors section.
#     If you have account access, you may use `wrangler tail` for logs.
